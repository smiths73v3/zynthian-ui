zynaudioplayer OSC implementation

Listens on UDP port 9000
Sends notifications to up to 5 registered clients via UDP on whichever port they registered

Control messages (recieved):
    All prefixed with /player<x> where <x> is the index of the player
    /transport [i=mode] Set transport play mode [0=stop, 1=play]
    /load [s=filename] Load file into player
    /unload Unload file from player
    /save [s=filename] Save file currently in player with (new) filename (not yet implemented)
    /position [f=position] Move playhead to position in seconds from start of file
    /loop [i=mode] Set loop mode [0=one-shot, 1=loop at end of file]
    /gain [f=gain] Set gain factor [0..2]
    /track_a [i=track] Select track for playback to left [-1..quantity of tracks, -1 for mix of odd tracks]
        Note mono files always present as mono on both outputs
    /track_b [i=track] Select track for playback to right [-1..quantity of track, -1 for mix of even tracks]
        Note mono files always present as mono on both outputs
    /quality [i=quality] Set samplerate conversion quality [0=best, 1=medium, 2=fastest, 3=zero order hold, 4=linear]
        Note change of quality only occurs after reloading file and only affects files with non-naitive samplerate
    /buffersize [i=size] Sets the quantity of frames in the input buffer
        Note change of buffer size only occurs after reloading file and may be used to optimise resource usage / performance
    /buffercount [i=count] Sets the quantity of buffers used
        Note change of buffer count only occurs after reloading file and may be used to optimise resource usage / performance

Notification messages (transmitted on change of value)
    All prefixed with /player<x> where <x> is the index of the player
    /transport [i=mode] Transport play mode [0=stopped, 1=playing]
    /load [s=filename] New file loaded (empty if file unloaded)
    /position [i=position] Playhead position in whole seconds from start of file
    /loop [i=mode] Loop mode [0=one-shot, 1=loop at end of file]
    /gain [f=gain] Gain factor [0..2]
    /duration [f=duration] Duration of loaded file
